- source_sentence: "I've never been able to talk with my parents. My parents are in\
    \ their sixties while I am a teenager. I love both of them but not their personalities.\
    \ I feel that they do not take me seriously whenever I talk about a serious event\
    \ in my life. If my dad doesn’t believe me, then my mom goes along with my dad\
    \ and acts like she doesn’t believe me either. I’m a pansexual, but I can’t trust\
    \ my own parents.\r\nI've fought depression and won; however, stress and anxiety\
    \ are killing me. I feel that my friends don't listen to me. I know they have\
    \ their own problems, which I do my best to help with. But they don't always try\
    \ to help me with mine, when I really need them. I feel as if my childhood has\
    \ been taken from me. I feel as if I have no one whom I can trust."
  sentences:
  - Best question is....what are you so angry about?&nbsp; You can't stop being so
    angry until you figure out what is the root of your anger.&nbsp; If you feel like
    you have anger inside, while I am sure you do.&nbsp; Taking it out on your son
    is only passing on the hurt and anger.&nbsp; This will be inside him too.&nbsp;
    Get some professional help so that you can be happy and have a happy child.
  - Have you tried rehearsing to yourself or a trusted friend what you will present
    to the class? &nbsp;&nbsp;The more confident you feel in a safe space, the more
    chance there will be of making the same presentation to a larger group.Giving
    presentations is not necessarily a difficulty with communication. &nbsp; It has
    more to do with performance than expressing yourself clearly.Practice, practice,
    and practice, until you see yourself improve in how you present.Also, keep in
    mind that whatever anxiety you may feel about making a mistake, the audience is
    almost alway much more forgiving than the person who feels anxious.Anxiety heightens
    fear, so whatever concerns you have, check if they are growing from anxiety instead
    of a realistic assessment of your abilities or audience receptivity.Good luck!
  - Teenage years are rough for anyone, and this is a time for self-discovery and
    experimentation. Having older parents can certainly pose challenges. Most kids
    feel like their parents don't understand them, but yours are older than the average
    parents of teenagers. They're from a completely different generation than you
    are. It sounds like they love you, but may not understand you. The problem here
    is the generation/age gap, and there's not a whole lot you can do about that.
    What you can do is accept the situation and perhaps look at it a little differently.
    It seems like you're looking for affirmation from them, looking for their approval
    and understanding. It's never a good idea to look to others to define who you
    are or to get a self-esteem boost. Who you are and how you feel about yourself
    needs to come from inside, not from outside. One way you can have a better relationship
    with your parents is to stop looking at all the things you aren't getting from
    them that you want, and rather look at all the things you are getting from them.
    Yes, this is a glass half full or half empty point of view, but it works. The
    negative will overshadow the positive if you let it. Start looking for the good
    things in your relationship with your parents and your feelings towards them will
    become more positive.I'm not sure how your friends/peers made you feel like your
    childhood has been taken from you. That's a curious statement, and requires a
    deeper conversation to understand where that came from. However, I do understand
    feeling different and out of place, especially in high school. Find the strength
    within yourself rather than looking to others in your life to make you feel better
    or feel like a complete person. It helps to have friends and loved ones, but you
    can never rely on them to fulfill all of your needs. Set some goals for your future,
    work towards them. Focus on being the best YOU that you can be, and the right
    people will enter your life at the right time.&nbsp;
- source_sentence: How do therapists classify the type of personality their clients
    have?  What characteristics do they look at to decide what type of personality
    the client has? I've read about this online, but I'd like to understand this from
    a therapist's point of view.
  sentences:
  - This is a great question, and I am happy to have the opportunity to explain my
    approach. When I am determining what type of personality a client has, I take
    my time and really absorb their lens/ point of view to themselves and others.
    Determining a personality type takes some time getting to know the person, and
    building rapport. After taking time to get to know them, and learning about their
    view they have of themselves and others, it is important to pick-up on more specific
    personality traits, which comprehensively contribute to a personality type. Clinicians,
    including myself, often witness certain traits that are enduring and consistent,
    which indicate a type of personality. For example, if a therapist is noticing
    that a client is exhibiting traits of organization, needing to be on time, planning,
    and perfectionism, these traits contribute to the "type A personality".&nbsp;In
    addition to utilizing clinical judgment, clinicians often use personality assessments
    and follow the guidelines of the DSM-5/ ICD-10.&nbsp;
  - I am very sorry for the pain you are suffering. Losing the most&nbsp;significant
    person in your life is extremely painful and breakups are often equated to a death.
    There will certainly be a grieving process that you go through and time passing
    will allow the hurt to subside. With that being said, seeing a therapist is highly
    recommended as it sounds like continuous support&nbsp;may be necessary for healing
    to take place. Anytime&nbsp;sadness causes thoughts of suicide or self harm, it
    is important to get help immediately.&nbsp;A therapist can help you by validating
    your feelings and what you are going&nbsp;through, while also working with you
    to move through the grieving process, adopt new hobbies, social outlets, and goals
    for your future. While starting over and trying out new ways of being may seem
    like a daunting task,&nbsp;it will only make things easier and give you a&nbsp;sense
    of hope and purpose for your future. With the new year right around the corner,
    this could be viewed as a good time and opportunity to get reaquainted with yourself
    and set goals related&nbsp;to living a more fullfilling life. Hang in there. With&nbsp;a
    support system in place and a healthy mindset, things can only get easier.&nbsp;Best
    of luck to you!&nbsp;&nbsp;
  - since you realize your sense of trust was broken, withdrawing from close relationships,
    makes sense.This may be your Self giving you natural time to recuperate from emotional
    pain.Also it is your chance to think over how to handle yourself differently in
    future relationships.Maybe this process requires more time than you'd like.Having
    patience is very difficult when a person feels hurt.A therapist of your own may
    be a good idea so you have someone for guidance and to chart your progress w you.This
    may feel less lonely and help you tolerate the waiting period till you're better
- source_sentence: I'm in college currently, so I am not a direct victim anymore.
    My father is very abusive with his words and actions, and my siblings are getting
    treated horribly.
  sentences:
  - Yes you can help!&nbsp; Emotional and verbal abuse can cause a negative impact
    in your family.&nbsp; It is important that you encourage your siblings to seek
    assistance with a therapist, and maybe help them find one, they should have school
    counselors available and if not our college counselor may help you to get referrals.&nbsp;
    It’s also a good idea to talk to your mom about the issue and ask her if she would
    like help as well.&nbsp; If you are concerned about your siblings' safety, contact
    Family Protective Services in your state, they will investigate and refer your
    father to classes or therapy as needed. It takes courage to do the right thing,
    you can do this!¿Hay algo que pueda hacer para ayudar a mis hermanos a escapar
    de nuestro emocionalmente abusivo padre?Actualmente estoy en la universidad, así
    que no soy victima directamente.&nbsp; Mi padre es muy abusivo con sus palabras
    y acciones, y trata a mis hermanos horriblemente.¡Tu si puedes ayudar!&nbsp; El
    abuso emocional y verbal puede causar daños graves en la familia.&nbsp; Es importante
    que motives a tus hermanos a visitar e incluso encontrar a un terapista, la escuela
    debe tener uno disponible, y también puedes pedirle referidos a tu Consejero universitario.&nbsp;
    También es buena idea que hables con tu mama al respecto y le preguntes si a ella
    le gustaría buscar ayuda.&nbsp; Si te preocupa la seguridad de tus hermanos, contacta
    a el Departamento de Protección a la Familia en tu estado para reportar el abuso.&nbsp;
    Ellos investigaran y determinaran si el hogar es un ambiente seguro par tus hermanos
    y recomendaran terapia o clases para tu papa.&nbsp; Hay que ser valiente para
    hacer lo correcto, ¡tú puedes hacerlo!

  - Hi Louisiana,You say that the problems are with your "past", but my hunch is the
    problems are about his insecurity and his personal barriers to trust (unless you've
    recently revealed details of a sordid past?). You don't mention ever having hurt
    the trust in the relationship.Trust is the first stage in a relationship. Moving
    forward before they develop trust is a common mistake couples make, and now you
    two have involved children in a relationship that's missing a crucial element.
    But you didn't see this coming, did you? That's because only as we become emotionally
    intimate do our deeper fears and insecurities come to the surface.&nbsp;I give
    you credit for wanting it to work, and I believe you would benefit from the support
    of a therapist in working through the kinks related to trust. Good luck!
- source_sentence: "My husband has had issues with alcohol addiction in the past (he'd\
    \ never admit to this). A while back (3 years ago), I asked him to stop drinking\
    \ so much, and he agreed. I caught him one night drinking behind my back. I confronted\
    \ him and he lied, but I told him I knew he was lying because I counted the beers\
    \ in the fridge and four of them were missing. He admitted and apologized and\
    \ promised he wouldn't do it again. Lately, my husband has been drinking on and\
    \ off, but I noticed it was every single night. I didn't like this. For our New\
    \ Year’s resolution, we decided we were going to limit our alcohol consumption.\
    \ He was on board—no more drinking every night.\r\nThe other night, I counted\
    \ the beers in the fridge just to see if some were missing. It took a couple of\
    \ days, but tonight, I discovered a few were missing along with a shot of vodka.\
    \ He was passed out on the couch when I decided to wake him up and confront him\
    \ (poor timing, but I couldn't wait). I asked him if he'd come to bed with me\
    \ (when he drinks, he snores and I cannot sleep—it's a dead giveaway he's been\
    \ drinking). He slurred a bit and said no. I asked if he had been drinking, but\
    \ he snapped and said no. I went into our room to sleep, leaving him on the couch.\
    \ \r\nI'm not sure if I'm overreacting or not. I just feel like I'm so honest\
    \ with him about everything, and I expect the same honesty. He is a good husband\
    \ in every other regard."
  sentences:
  - The feeling of never feeling good enough usually stems from our early relationship
    with our parents or significant role models who made us to feel we were never
    good enough to meet their standards. In the healing process, you'll need to work
    on discovering the root source of where these thoughts and feelings come from
    and then learn to accept yourself just as you are unconditionally. I'd be pleased
    to help you in this process. I provide online private counseling through proventherapy.com.
    Dr. Rachelle Vaughan
  - Usually people call me by phone, they introduce themselves, we chat for a bit,
    then we schedule a time for their appointment
  - It can be very frustrating being lied to. &nbsp;The one thing that struck me was
    the sentence he had a alcohol addiction "in the past." &nbsp;Addiction is not
    something that comes and goes. &nbsp;Once you have addict tendencies they are
    here to stay. &nbsp;You may be able to fight them off for awhile but the will
    enviably rear their ugly head again. &nbsp;Some of the things that we would suggest
    is taking the access away. &nbsp;If the alcohol is not conveniently in the house
    he would have to go seek it out elsewhere. &nbsp;You can think about it in other
    terms. &nbsp;If chocolate cake was your favorite food and you were a diabetic,
    you would not have chocolate cake lying around all the time because you know you
    would eventually eat it. &nbsp;Remember there are no temporary addicts.
- source_sentence: It happens especially at me and my sister, and then she gets emotional
    and brings up the past. How should I deal with it? She is always stressed about
    her work and doesn't put her family first.
  sentences:
  - A good first step would be to make an appointment with your primary care provider
    &amp; discuss your concerns.  They would have resources available to help in your
    particular situation.
  - Anger is a normal emotion, and yet it is a really hard one... how much is too
    much? and how do you express it without damaging those around you? yes mom's get
    angry, sometimes too easy... but its their responsibility to manage their anger--
    get their own support and put themselves in time outs when they cannot handle
    it well.&nbsp; Since you are the kids, you shouldn't have to fix or calm down
    mom's anger. Maybe in a calmer time when you guys are being silly talk with her
    one on one? Tell her&nbsp; you are feeling sad and hurt that she gets upset at
    you girls. Ask her if there is 1 thing you can work on this next month to help
    her. Ask her if she would work on 1 thing for you this month-- not yelling? taking
    a time out? telling you before she blows her top so you can exit the room? Also
    for you, check out a library book on anger so you know how to handle yours, and
    one on parents and anger. Number one to remember, if you don't feel safe, if she
    is calling you names, or hurting you, breaking things etc. make sure you go to
    a trusted adult--school counselor, neighbor, aunt, church friend as soon as possible.
    You are much too important to be hurt and if mom is out of control, someone else&nbsp;needs
    to be --caring for you.
  - Sorry hearing about the big amount of stress which you are feeling at this time.Since
    a lot of your stress is directed to uncertainty of whether your wife is happy
    being with you, would you consider continuing the conversation with her about
    your understanding of her answer to you?Your observation that she says one thing
    and behaves in a different way, is meaningful.Bringing your point to her attention
    would at the very least demonstrate her interest in showing and explaining her
    viewpoint about you.Basically, you'd be expecting her to care about you and how
    she handles herself with this question, may clarify what you're trying to find
    out.The good news about your relationship with alcohol, is that you realize you're
    overdoing it.From what you write, the emotional pain and helplessness you feel
    currently, seem too much to know about all at once.One possibility is to accept
    your feelings of hurt and insecurity. &nbsp;This is the first step of working
    with them. &nbsp; If they start feeling overwhelming, then maybe too, you can
    distract yourself for a while from the intensity by engaging in an activity that
    is not self-harming.After all, you are the most important person in your life,
    so keep yourself safe and healthy!

What are the issues that are most troubling you? Are these situations creating an impact on your daily routine?Second, do some research as to the type of counselling service you are looking and that would best suit your needs. Are you looking for individual sesssions, couples/family sessions, etc. And research potential therapists in your area that focus their counselling approach on your therapeutic needs.&nbsp;Third, contact the therapist (most don't answer the phones, so leave a message or send an email). Don't be affraid to ask questions. You want to make sure that this professional is a good "match" for you and will work with you at working toward your therapeutic goals (the things you want to address/work on during the sessions).Fourth, have the expectation that, depending on the issues, you will need multiple sessions/appointments with the therapist to really address the issues and work toward your therapeutic goals.It takes strength and courage to reach out for help, but I know you can reach your goals. It takes time, patience, and practice do really address your needs.&nbsp;Good luck!</code> |
  | <code>I'm in my late teens and live with my dad.  The only time I go out is for my college classes. Sometimes when I see my friends I want to talk with them, but sometimes I won't want to talk to them for days or even weeks.   <br>  <br>Sometimes I feel i'm not worth knowing or i'm never going to do anything right.  <br>  <br>Are they right, am I depressed?</code> | <code>If we were in my office together, I would offer that most likely you are feeling somewhat depressed. It's most important for me to impress that you "don't have to live like this..."&nbsp; Other helpful information: Have you experienced similar symptoms before?&nbsp; Anyone in&nbsp; your family been depressed before?&nbsp; Based on other physiological signs, like quality of sleep, appetite, energy/motivation, I would present you with some treatment options, one of which would be to consult with a medication management provider to assess your symptoms and provide additional information for you to consider.</code>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
